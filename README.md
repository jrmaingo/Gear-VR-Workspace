# Gear VR Workspace
A simple development environment that uses a Samsung Gear VR headset and a computer to create a more ergonomic workspace that is not limited by physical obstructions.

## Current Status
We have a README file!

## Project Goals
- provide virtual editor screens for users to treat like separate screens (like in a multi-screen development environment)
- integrated terminal and web browser
- environment runs on user's computer and displays to the headset

## OS Support
Currently only developing on OS X

## Technologies
- currently looking into using [GearVRf](https://github.com/Samsung/GearVRf) for headset output
- still looking at options for computer end of program
    - considering creating extension for Atom to provide editor
- also considering using WebVR for a independant Gear VR version (would not require computer)
